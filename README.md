Overall tips - soldering isn't super hard/scary but it takes some time to learn, shit will go wrong occasionally that's chill 

# tools 

- whenever possible avoid using an iron that plugs directly into the wall - these are annoying and fuck your shit up sometimes - finding a space with a desktop solder setup that you can use is especially helpful because usually it comes along with people that have electronics experience and that's the best thing there is (you can learn on a wall plug iron though that's fine - just know that if you're gonna be doing a decent amount of soldering its worth it to buy a real setup - they're pretty cheap)

- google "automatic wire strippers" - check out the ones that look like a little dinosaur mouth thing - usually blue and yellow or orange and yellow - try not to get the absolute cheapest cheapos (spending more than 10 less than 20 probably does the trick) these shits absolutely rock - you can look up how to use them it's incredibly easy and it will save so much hassle - if you're cutting really tiny wire fuck around with the screw on the back 

- google "helping hands soldering" these are an absolute must - you will be in many situations where you need to hold a bunch of shit together in tight spots - the cheap ones are fine, cool big expensive ones also cool but not necesarily necessary. Also a little vice like a panavise jr or a circuit board holder can be a real life saver if you're working on stuff with different bits on it that need soldering 

- a decent metal tip cleany thing is good too (looks like coarse steel wool in a little open dome)` 
- safety equipment is a fume collecting fan an safety glasses but generally if you're not soldering a shit ton the fumes probably aren't a huge deal (lead solder is nicer to work with but more toxic I think) - safety glasses can be more useful than u think when shit starts spitting out of the solder but tbh most people don't wear them 

# Soldering

- prep: get your iron hot, shove it in the metal spongey thing, then touch some solder to the tip to coat the tip (this is called tipping, duhhhhh)

- 'tipping' wires (covering them in solder) - hold the tipped iron against the exposed wire, and wait, after a bit start tapping the wire with a new strand of solder - when the wire is hot enough the solder will cling and coat the whole wire by itself - you'll know things are hot enough because it will do this basically all on its own (thicker wire takes longer)

- attaching wire to something else: lay down a bit of solder on the pad/contact or component (whatever you're soldering the wire to) - again press the tipped iron against the contact and wait a bit, then feed in some solder to coat - now press the tipped wire on the tipped contact and put the iron on top - the two coated surfaces melt into each other - then remove heat and let it cool until it solidifies

# Pro Tips to live by:

- solder is only ever completely liquid or completely solid - when it gets above its solid temperature it's liquid, below its solid - theres no give/inbetween/squishiness to it - its one or the other

- heat is best transferred from solder to solder - that's why we cover the tip in solder and then hold that to what we're trying to solder - you basically never want to be touching a dry tip to something to try and heat it up - this doesn't work vey well

- when in doubt wait and be patient - a lot of times if something isn't working it's because the things you're trying to solder together aren't hot enough - the bigger the solid component the more time it takes to heat up - you can't rush stuff

- required listening material while soldering is golden era hip hop or 90s/2000s house, garage, etc. - a full day of soldering can be extremely relaxing and fulfilling

- careful about who you listen to and deal with in the electronics community. There are a lot of annoying people, there are a lot of people with engineer brain that don't understand much else - best are people that treat you like an equal and teach you stuff, and are also actually knowledgeable as hell. The skew is generally towards over perfection and getting into the tiny details of engineering shit - as an artist sometimes it doesn't fucking matter and you can just do what works - engineers most useful when you fuck something up you don't really understand, or when you need to be pointed to other resources. Hackers are the best resource - like normal engineers but they understand practicality, make stuff that works, have way better politics and are way more fun to hang around - much less limited in terms of imagining new solutions etc. 

# dealing with fuck ups 

- solder wick (weird copper mesh looking thing) is a good way to suck up solder that got in the wrong place - just touch it over the solder you want to get rid of and put the iron on top of it, and when the solder goes liquid it will get sucked into the copper - solder acts pretty globby so usually you can get a whole failed solder job cleanly at once. There's also air suction tools but solder wick is cheap and simple. 

- there is no "getting away with it" in soldering - you will at times be tempted to melt a blob of solder onto something and drop it on, stick something on it etc. and then say ah it looks solid that's fine - this will fuck you over - the worst thing is having bad solder joints and not knowing it/not knowing where. Remember - everything involved with the solder has to be nice and hot - things should flow and stick on their own, and the best connecctions are always between solder to solder - if you have to push the solder around a lot and kind of force it into place, the stuff you're trying to solder isn't hot enough (usually the answer to this is patience not turning up the heat on the iron) 

- If your iron is too hot shit can go wrong - you'll start burning plastic stuff left and right, thing will look burnt, less control etc. - I usually go pretty hot like 3/4 of the max setting on an iron depending on the iron - you can find your own sweet spot

- if you burn or rip off an important connection this is usually salvegable - follow the connect back and solder from there (sometimes you have to sand off a top layer on a circuit board to expose the wire path underneath) - if it's a tight/fragile space you can use solder paste and a hot air gun to melt some extra metal into place on your path 

- if your solder looks matte that's usually a bad sign - redo it - you can look up other common solder problems but that's the most common one I run into - but sometimes matte is okay? I think it depends on the situation - not an expert but matte solders are supposedly worse - probably worth worrying about on important projects and not worth worrying about on non important projects
